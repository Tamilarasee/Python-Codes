Project Description: The project implements a faithful iterative DFS with stack in linear time
such that
1. each node enters the stack exactly once;
2.  the parent of a node is set once; and
3.  the same DFS forest and node order as the recursive DFS are returned.

The input and output are written through separate files to handle larger number of nodes and edges
